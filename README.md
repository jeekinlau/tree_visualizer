# Orchard Tree Visualizer webapp
## About
This is a tool that allows you to visualize an orchard planting on a map.
(Caution: this tool is still under Development, features needed is more accurate GPS)

Primary use of the tool is to visualize the planting plan of the orchard and see if it fits the topographical features such as ditches and such.
Development of the tool was based out of necessity to see how my new orchard would fit in a weird trapezoidal shaped parcel of land.

In the left side bar, you can input the parameter of the field. Make sure your rows and plants per row is greater than the number of plants you are planning to plant.

You can also choose the colors of the dots representing the trees and what kind of map (satellite view is default)

You are able to move the orchard up, down, left, right, and then spin it clockwise and counter clockwise
